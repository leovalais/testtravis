= Test Travis CI

This repository is dedicated to experimentations with [[https://travis-ci.org/|Travis CI]].
It is also a playground for experimentations with integrating the project
[[https://github.com/ocsigen/html_of_wiki|html_of_wiki]] to a Travis CI. It is a documentation
generator for GitHub Pages written in OCaml.

== mymath
Contains some Python math functions. Please see the full list below:

; ##fact##
: computes the factorial
; ##inc##
: increments its parameter
; ##negabs##
: ##negabs(x) = -abs(x)##

== test_mymath
Contains tests written for ##pytest## of the functions described above.

Some tests are properties tests. Please see Haskell's QuickCheck for
much more detail about that sort of tests.
TODO: write a decorator @ptest to factorize the common parts

== Contributing
The repo has three branches:
* ##master## --- Contains the code. Travis CI {{{pytest}}} everything.
* ##wikidoc## --- Contains the documentation. Travis CI regenerates it each time a commit is added to this branch. It uses {{{html_of_wiki}}}.
* ##gh-pages## --- Website server (GitHub Pages). Do not touch it manually since everything can be erased.
